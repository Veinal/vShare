# Project Title: P2P Link & File Sharer

## 1. Project Vision & Goal

To create a frictionless, secure, and ephemeral web application for sharing links and files directly between two devices in real-time. The primary goal is to eliminate the need for logins, accounts, or intermediate services like email or messaging apps for simple, one-off transfers, prioritizing speed and privacy.

## 2. The Core Problem

In many environments, such as college computer labs, offices, or public spaces, users need a quick way to transfer a piece of information (a link, a snippet of text, or a small file) from one computer to another. Existing methods are often cumbersome:
- Logging into personal accounts (email, cloud storage, social media) on a public or shared computer is a security risk.
- Using USB drives is not always possible or convenient.
- Setting up a dedicated sharing service is overkill for a temporary need.

This project solves this by providing an instant, browser-based, peer-to-peer (P2P) transfer mechanism.

## 3. Key Features

- **Instant Session Creation:** On visiting the website, a user is immediately assigned a unique, easy-to-read session code (e.g., `BLUE-CAT-7`). No signup is required.
- **Peer-to-Peer Connection:** Users connect by having a second device enter the session code generated by the first.
- **Real-time Data Transfer:** Once connected, data is transferred directly between the two browsers using WebRTC. This is extremely fast and private, as the data does not pass through a central server.
- **File Sharing:** Users can drag-and-drop one or more files to initiate a transfer. The receiving user will see a prompt to accept and download the files.
- **Link & Text Sharing:** Users can paste a URL or any snippet of text to have it instantly appear on the connected device's screen, ready to be copied.
- **Ephemeral & Secure:** The connection and session are temporary. Once the browser tab is closed, the session code is invalidated, and the connection is terminated. No data or user information is ever stored on a server.
- **Responsive & Clean UI:** The user interface is minimalist, intuitive, and works seamlessly on both desktop and mobile browsers.

## 4. User Flow

1.  **Sender (Device A):**
    - Opens the web application.
    - Is immediately presented with a unique session code (e.g., `BLUE-CAT-7`).
    - Drags a file into the browser window or pastes a link/text into an input field.

2.  **Receiver (Device B):**
    - Opens the same web application.
    - Clicks on "Receive" or "Enter Code".
    - Types in the session code (`BLUE-CAT-7`) provided by the Sender.

3.  **Connection & Transfer:**
    - A direct P2P connection is established between Device A and Device B.
    - The file or text sent by Device A instantly appears on Device B's screen.
    - Device B can download the file or copy the text.

4.  **Session End:**
    - Either user closes the browser tab.
    - The connection is severed, and the session becomes invalid.

## 5. Technology Stack

- **Frontend Framework:** **Next.js (with React)** - Provides a robust framework for building a fast, server-rendered React application.
- **Language:** **TypeScript** - For type safety and improved developer experience.
- **Styling:** **Tailwind CSS** - For rapid, utility-first styling.
- **UI Components:** **Shadcn/ui** - A collection of beautifully designed, accessible, and reusable components.
- **P2P Communication:** **WebRTC (Web Real-Time Communication)** - A browser API that enables direct peer-to-peer connections for sending data without a server intermediary.
- **Signaling Server:** **Node.js + Socket.IO** - A simple backend service (integrated within the Next.js app as an API route) is required for "signaling." Its only job is to help the two browsers find and introduce each other to initiate the WebRTC connection. It does not handle the file/data transfer itself.

## 6. Architecture Overview

The application consists of two main parts:

1.  **The Next.js Frontend:** This is what the user interacts with. It handles the UI, state management, and all the client-side logic for initiating and managing the WebRTC connection.
2.  **The Socket.IO Signaling Server:** This is a lightweight backend component. When a user starts a session, their browser connects to this server. When a second user wants to connect, they also connect to this server and use the session code to be "introduced" to the first user. The server passes connection metadata (like IP addresses and capabilities) between the two clients so they can form a direct WebRTC link. After that, the server's job is done, and the data flows directly between the peers.
